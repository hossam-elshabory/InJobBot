# How to Get Your Bot Token

To set up a new bot, you will need to talk to BotFather. No, he’s not a person – he’s also a bot, and he's the boss of all the Telegram bots.

1. Search for @botfather in Telegram.

!!! warning "Be Careful"
    Make sure you store the token securely. Anyone with your token access can easily manipulate your bot.
